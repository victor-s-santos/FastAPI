# Using_Base_Model
- As my first experience with FastAPI, I am going to develop a very simple api using the Base Model.

# Content
- I am using pydantic BaseModel to create the objects(User);
- the User objects are appended to a user_list;
- I've created an endpoint to get all list of users, an endpoint to get a specific user, and an endpoint to post a new user.
